## Code Documentation
You can see the code's documentation by opening this file with your default navigator: [documentation main page](docs/_build/html/index.html).

## Setup
The required package are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
Because OpenCV is also a dependance, you should follow the installation instructions from the [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.9.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html).

Think about creating your [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install required dependencies there.
